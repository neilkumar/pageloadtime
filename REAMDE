GOAL: to make an equivalent of firefox's lori plugin


LORI displays:

* TTFB: how long it took to see the first byte from remote server (from click to first byte received). This value gives a rough estimate on when the browser can start laying out the content.

* TTC: how long it took to display the page (from click to complete drawing of the page)

* Page size (number of bytes used to display the page): this value includes both bytes fetched from network and bytes fetched from the browser's cache.

* Number of requests: number of requests used to fetch the page's content (images, style-sheet, javascript ....). Again, this value include both network requests and cache requests.
